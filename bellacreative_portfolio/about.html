                <h1>Hi! I'm Bella!</h1>
                <p>My name is Bella Piety! I am a Graphic Design and Web Developmentstudent. 
                    Ever since I was young I loved doing anything that allowed me to create something beautiful.Over the years those creations have ranged greatly. As a child I was self taught in multiple hobbies including guitar, piano, and songwriting and production, as well as more art based hobbies such as painting, and sketching. I also ran my own business during Covid where I would design, make , and sell my own handmade clay earrings. I am diligent and hardworking. I see problems as puzzles to solve instead of impossible obstacles.</p>
                    <p>When I'm not designing you can probably find me at the beach or hanginig with my family.</p>
